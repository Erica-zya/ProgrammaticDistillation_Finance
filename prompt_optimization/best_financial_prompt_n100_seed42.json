The carrying amounts and estimated fair values of the Company’s financial instruments not recorded at fair value in the financial statements were as follows:\nThe fair values of long-term debt as of June 30, 2019 and June 30, 2018 were determined by using current interest rates for debt with terms and maturities similar to the Company’s existing debt arrangements and accordingly would be classified as Level 2 inputs in the fair value hierarchy.\nThe carrying amount of company-owned life insurance reflects cash surrender values based upon the market values of underlying securities, using Level 2 inputs, net of any outstanding policy loans. The carrying value associated with the cash surrender value of these policies is recorded in other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.\nFor purposes of performing Step 1 of goodwill impairment testing, the Company uses certain nonrecurring fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3). Fair value of each reporting unit for purposes of the goodwill impairment test is based on a weighting of an income approach and a market approach. Under the income approach, fair value is determined based on a discounted cash flow analysis that uses estimates of cash flows discounted to present value using rates commensurate with the risks associated with those cash flows. Under the market approach, a market-based value is derived by relating multiples for earnings and cash flow measures for a group of comparable public companies to the same measure for each reporting unit to estimate fair value. The assumptions used by the Company to determine fair value of the reporting units are similar to those that would be used by market participants performing valuations.",

    "instructions": "Write a Python program that answers the given QUESTION using the provided TABLE and PARAGRAPHS. The program should follow these steps:\n\n1. **Extract Data**: Identify and extract the relevant data from the TABLE and PARAGRAPHS based on the QUESTION.\n2. **Perform Calculations**: Perform the necessary arithmetic or logical operations to compute the final answer.\n3. **Store the Answer**: Store the computed answer in a variable named 'ans'.\n4. **Determine Scale**: Infer the appropriate scale for the answer from the context. The scale MUST be one of: \"\", \"percent\", \"thousand\", \"million\", \"billion\".\n5. **Format Output**: Ensure the final output is in the specified JSON format.\n\n### Specific Guidelines:\n- **Multi-Span Rule**: If the QUESTION asks for multiple items (e.g., 'which years', 'list all'), 'ans' MUST be a list of strings. Otherwise, 'ans' is a single string.\n- **Scale Inference**: If the scale is \"\", 'ans' must be a fully-resolved number (no remaining scaling).\n- **Output Format**: The LAST line of the program MUST be: `print(json.dumps({\"ans\": ans, \"scale\": scale}, ensure_ascii=False))`.\n- **Raw Python Only**: Output only the raw Python code. No Markdown, no comments, no other print statements.\n\n### Example:\nIf the QUESTION is \"What is the sum of company's total assets between 2018 to 2019?\", the program should:\n1. Extract the total assets for 2019 and 2018 from the TABLE.\n2. Calculate the sum of these values.\n3. Store the result in 'ans'.\n4. Determine the scale as \"million\".\n5. Print the result in JSON format.",
