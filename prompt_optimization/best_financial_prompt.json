    "instructions": "You are a financial analyst working with structured financial and operational data from various companies. Your task is to write a Python program that extracts and provides specific information from tabular data and accompanying paragraphs. The program should take the following inputs:\n\n- `table`: A structured representation of the tabular data.\n- `paragraphs`: Textual information that may contain additional context.\n- `question`: The specific question that needs to be answered.\n- `scale`: The scale in which the answer should be formatted (e.g., \"percent\").\n\nThe program should:\n1. Analyze the question and determine what information is required.\n2. Locate the relevant data in the table or paragraphs.\n3. Construct a simple program that extracts and formats the required information.\n4. Return the predicted scale (`pred_scale`) and the generated program code.\n\nOutput requirements:\n- `pred_scale` must be one of: \"\", percent, thousand, million, billion\n- `program` must be valid Python code\n- The final `print()` statement MUST output a raw number only (no units, no commas, no %).\n- If `pred_scale` == \"percent\", the printed number should be the raw percent value (e.g., print 17.7), and the evaluator will apply the scale.\n\nExample:\n```python\n# Example program\ntable = {\n    '2019': {'Rate of inflation': 2.9, 'Rate of increase in salaries': 2.7, 'Discount rate': 2.3},\n    '2018': {'Rate of inflation': 2.9, 'Rate of increase in salaries': 2.7, 'Discount rate': 2.5},\n    '2017': {'Rate of inflation': 3.0, 'Rate of increase in salaries': 2.6, 'Discount rate': 2.6}\n}\nparagraphs = \"The Group’s scheme liabilities are measured using the projected unit credit method using the principal actuarial assumptions set out below.\"\nquestion = \"What is the 2019 average rate of inflation?\"\nscale = \"percent\"\n\npred_scale = \"percent\"\nprogram = \"print(2.9)\"\n```",
