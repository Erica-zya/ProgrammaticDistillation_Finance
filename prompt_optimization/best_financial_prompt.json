Their useful lives and potential impairment are reviewed at the end of each financial year.\nSOFTWARE UNDER DEVELOPMENT\nCosts incurred in developing products or systems and costs incurred in acquiring software and licenses that will contribute to future period financial benefits through revenue generation and/or cost reduction are capitalised to software and systems.
